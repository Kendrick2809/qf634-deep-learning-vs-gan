# Applied Quantitative Research Methods

## Project Overview
This repository presents an advanced predictive model for stock price movements, developed using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework that integrates Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This model is designed to enhance prediction accuracy beyond that of traditional LSTM and GRU models.

### Highlights of the Model
- **GAN Framework**: Utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network to refine the predictive accuracy and robustness of stock price forecasts.
- **Bi-LSTM Integration**: Incorporates Bi-directional LSTM layers to capture patterns from both past and future contexts effectively.
- **CNN Enhancement**: Employs CNN layers for feature extraction from complex time-series data, improving the granularity of input data analysis.
- **Comparative Performance**: Demonstrates superior performance metrics compared to standalone LSTM and GRU models through rigorous back-testing.

### Model Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to offer a robust tool for financial analysts and traders to predict stock price movements more accurately, thereby enabling more informed investment decisions.
